<p>Last time, we wrote some persuasive copy for your ad and, combined with your engaging image, BAM! You now have a Facebook ad that is virtually <em>guaranteed</em> to get results...</p>

<p>IF we target it correctly.</p>

<p>Get this part wrong, and your whole campaign will fall apart. Get it right, and your results will shoot through the roof.</p>

<p>So what <em>is</em> targeting anyways?</p>

<p>Targeting is where you get to select the <em>exact</em> audience who you want to see your ad. (Keyword: <em>exact</em>.)</p>

<p>Because think about it, your ad could be the greatest, most persuasive ad ever in the history of Facebook ads, but if it’s not going out to the people who are actually <em>looking</em> for what you have to offer, it’s going to be a flop.</p>

<p>So today we’ll set up a Custom Audience for you inside Facebook which is full of people who are looking specifically for what <em>you</em> have to offer. The more specific we can get here, the better.</p>

<p>You ready? Let’s create a Custom Audience!</p>

<h2>How to Create a Custom Audience When You Don’t Have an Audience</h2>

<p>If you are just starting your blog or your business, and you have little to no subscribers or traffic, you may be asking the question… How do I create a Custom Audience inside Facebook when I have no audience to begin with?</p>

<p>If you've read or heard about targeting on Facebook before, you probably know that you can upload your email list to create something called a “Lookalike Audience” (which is where Facebook finds other people to target who have similar attributes).</p>

<p>But what if you don't have an email list?</p>

<p>You’ve probably also heard that you can create Custom Audiences and “Lookalike” Audiences out of your Facebook fans.</p>

<p>But what if you don’t have any Facebook fans either?</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a very simple, yet powerful, way to find people to target, even when you are starting from complete scratch: by using a section of your Facebook Ads Manager called “Audience Insights."</p>

<p>I cover exactly how to target people with Audience Insights (using “Interests”) at the beginning of this video:</p>

</div>

<p>  </p>

<p>So, by finding other Facebook pages that your target audience likes, you can send your ads specifically to those people.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say I’m in the dog food industry. I can find my competitors pages on Facebook, such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dogfoodadvisor?ref=br_rs">Dog Food Advisor</a> for instance, and target my ads specifically to people who “like” Dog Food Advisor.</p>

<p>Easy, right?</p>

<h2>This Simple Trick Can Double Your Audience Size in 2 Minutes</h2>

<p>Now here’s a really cool “ninja” trick:</p>

<p>If you add other countries inside your Custom Audience, you can find even MORE people to target, and the competition for these other countries outside the U.S. is often <em>lower</em>.</p>

<p>(Remember, your ads are competing against other ads in an auction, so less competition = $$$ cheaper ads!)</p>

<p>But how do you know which other countries to target for any given target group?</p>

<p>Well, you could just make a guess, and start adding countries like crazy until you see a spike in your audience size, and then you'll know you've hit gold. But there's an easier way...</p>

<p>Rick Mulready shows a really cool trick for finding more countries to target in this video:</p>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>

<p>Ready to go create a Custom Audience? Follow the steps in the two videos above, and I’ll see you next week when we’ll pull it all together and get your campaign sending you subscribers while you sleep!</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you haven’t done so already, I invite you to attend a free workshop with Rick Mulready: He'll show you how to get big results from your Facebook Ads with minimal cost...</p>

<p>I guarantee you will get some valuable info about how to set up your campaigns properly by attending this training. I've found that most people who are having problems with their FB ads are missing one of these foundational steps.</p>
