<p>Isn’t it annoying how some bloggers seem to hog all the publicity, while your blog just sort of... sits there?</p>
<p>It’s not for lack of trying. You’re cranking out more valuable content than <em>10</em> of those pesky bloggers put together!</p><p>(Well, it certainly <em>feels</em> like it.)</p>
<p>So writing isn't the problem. An uber-important message is just pouring out of your soul that people <em>really need to hear.</em> The frustrating part is, <strong>nobody is listening.</strong></p>
<p>The feeling harkens back to when you were a school kid at recess, waiting to get picked for a game by the team captain... You just want to wave your hand up in the air and shout,</p>
<p><em>Pick me! Pick me!</em></p>
<p>But with each name that gets called, your heart drops. Everyone else is getting picked, and it seems like you'll be the lonely last one standing.</p>
<p>Well, there’s good news and there’s bad news...</p>
<p>The bad news is, it is becoming increasingly difficult for bloggers to stand out amid all the noise. As of July 2015, there are over <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/256235/total-cumulative-number-of-tumblr-blogs/">246.6 million blog accounts</a> <em>on Tumblr alone</em>.</p>
<p>As a result, only an itty-bitty fraction of the entire blogosphere... let’s estimate 1%... has actually achieved popular status. (By popular, I mean that they have a substantial audience.)</p>
<p><strong>If you want to get into that top 1%, you are going to have to be absolutely <em>extraordinary.</em></strong></p>
<p>The good news is, most bloggers don’t even stand a chance. I know that sounds harsh, but it's true.</p>
<p>That's where your golden opportunity comes in...</p>

<h3>This is Your Chance to Be the Leader of the Pack</h3>
<img src="/img/race.jpg" class="image-left">
<p>You see, most bloggers won't ever get picked–they will never get much traffic, and they will never build a large audience–<em>because they don't understand the rules of the game.</em></p>
<p>They think that to become popular, you must first hunker down and write a lot of blog posts (bonus points for high quality).</p>
<p>But that is not the way you win at this game.</p>
<p>To win out over all the other blogs out there, you don't have the luxury of blogging first and letting your audience find you later. You have to find <em>them</em> first, then come out with guns blazing!</p>
<p>In this mini course, I will show you how to leverage guest blogging to become an extraordinary player, get noticed by the "popular kids", and win as many fans and subscribers as you want, <em>before you even launch your own blog.</em></p>
<p>Yep, you heard it: you don’t have to write a <em>single post</em> on your blog to grow an audience! Here's how...</p>

<h3>How to Surpass the 99% of Unappreciated Bloggers and Get Into the Elite 1%</h3>
<p>As you’ve probably already guessed by the title of this course, the key is to begin by posting on <em>other</em> people’s blogs, instead of your own blog.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like schmoozing with the popular kids before the game even starts… If they already know and like you, they are much more likely to pick you.</p>
<p>Here are <em>3 reasons why you should grow your audience in this order</em> (guest blogging first, launch your own blog second):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It's pointless to write to an audience that doesn't exist.</strong><br>Posting on your own blog before you have subscribers is like speaking to an empty stadium. It doesn’t matter how great your speech is if no one is there to hear it. (To be fair, you <em>could</em> grow an audience this way… sometime in the next decade. But I’m guessing you want quicker results than that.)</li>
<li><strong>You can take a piece of someone else's traffic for yourself.</strong><br>Convert that traffic, and then, once you have, say, 1000 subscribers, you will have an audience to listen to you. Those people will share your content, and your audience will continue to grow organically.</li>
<li><strong>The "popular kids" (A-list bloggers) give you instant credibility by association.</strong><br>You don’t need credentials, you don’t need experience, you don’t even need your own blog! People simply assume that you are a big shot because you've shared the stage with other big shots. Also, because your work has been vetted by A-list bloggers, you get on the radar of <em>other</em> A-list bloggers who can help you by sharing your content in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds pretty great, right? </p>
<p>But if this is the way to “win” at the game of blogging, then how come more people aren’t doing it?</p>
<p>Maybe they’re scared of approaching the popular kids.</p>
<p>Maybe they’re afraid that they’ll write their best content for someone else, and run out of good ideas for their own blog.</p>
<p>Maybe the thought of doing it this way hasn’t even occurred to them because they’ve heard just the opposite: that you’re supposed to work hard, write tons of content in the complete darkness of your own blog, and <em>then</em>, after you’ve "paid your dues", <em>then</em> you are worthy to come out into the light and promote yourself.</p>
<p>As you’ll soon find out, some of these fears and beliefs are justifiable (yes, you <em>should be</em> scared to approach popular bloggers), and others are not (if you do the work, you will have more ideas than you could ever execute).</p>
<p>But there is perhaps a more elusive, yet common reason why bloggers don’t do guest blogging first. Maybe you have been caught up making this mistake yourself...</p>
<p>The reason is, these bloggers have <em>a fundamental misunderstanding of how Search Engine Optimization (SEO) really works.</em></p>
<h3>The Tragic Error Most Smart Bloggers Make</h3>
<img src="/img/google.jpg" class="image-right">
<p>These bloggers are not stupid. In fact, they’re the <em>smart</em> ones because they’ve done their homework, they've boned up on SEO, and made sure their posts were optimized correctly for their keywords before they posted them, so as to get as much search engine traffic as possible.</p>
<p>So where's the tragedy?</p>
<p>The big tragedy is, they are <em>never</em> going to get on the 1st page of Google.</p>
<p>On-page SEO may have worked in the past (before the blogosphere really blew up), but for most niches where there is a real market, it is simply too competitive to get search engine traffic this way anymore.</p>
<h4>Forget Everything You Were Told About SEO</h4>
<p>I’m about to tell you something that will completely change the way you think about getting exposure for your blog.</p>
<p>Here’s how you <em>really</em> play this game (and how you get to page 1 of Google):</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimizing your post for keywords has nothing to do with how high you rank in Google. <em>High-quality backlinks do.</em> Links to your blog from authority sites tell Google how important you are. So first, you need to get some quality backlinks.</li>
<li>Once Google sees you as important, <em>optimizing your post tells Google which keywords your post should rank for.</em> Only do this <em>after</em> you get backlinks, otherwise you are just wasting your time.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, finding keywords and optimizing your posts for them is like trying to swim upstream: your efforts will be completely futile, unless Google already sees you as important.</p>
<p><strong>To become important in Google’s eyes, you must have popular blogs linking to your content.</strong></p>
<p>So how on earth do you get popular blogs to link to your content, especially when you are a total nobody with zero qualifications?</p>
<p>You guessed it: <em>by guest posting on them!</em></p>
<p>(More specifically, by getting that author bio at the bottom of your guest post with a link back to your blog.)</p>
<p>Better yet, that little link at the bottom of your guest post will get lots of clicks... Not just any clicks, but <em>prequalified</em> clicks from people who have already read your content and loved it. These are <em>your</em> people.</p>
<p>You see, there are many popular blogs in need of great content, and they are more than willing to trade that content in exchange for a link back to your site. All you have to do is <em>create the content.</em></p>

<h3>Get Picked For the A-Team</h3>
<img src="/img/team.jpg" class="image-left">
<p>Imagine, instead of waiting for the cool kids to pick you, you're on their team. And pretty soon, you're one of their star players. And pretty soon after that, you are one of the cool kids yourself, picking out your <em>own</em> team!</p>
<p>No more twiddling your thumbs, speaking to an empty room, your words getting lost in a crowded blogosphere.</p>
<p>Instead of swimming against the current, you are riding in on a <em>giant wave</em> of traffic!</p>
<p><strong>There’s just one problem...</strong></p>
<p>There is a <em>ton</em> of competition.</p>
<p>Popular blogs may receive <em>hundreds</em> of pitches per week. So like I mentioned before, if you are going to stand out, you are going to have to be extraordinary.</p>
<p>More on being extraordinary in the next lesson.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Mary</p>
<p>P.S. Before we meet here again, I just want to thank two people who made this mini course possible: Jon Morrow, whose <a href="http://www.guestblogging.com">Guest Blogging certification course</a> completely changed the game for me. And Glen Long, who gave me a chance to write for Boost Blog Traffic. Thank you, Jon and Glen!</p>
