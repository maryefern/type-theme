<p>In the last lesson, we brainstormed some irresistible incentive ideas for people to subscribe to your email list, and you took the last week to create that incentive.</p>

<p>You’ll also need a landing page to showcase your incentive, with a form for people to enter their email address and get access. We won’t go into landing pages in this mini course, but I do briefly cover my favorite resources for building landing pages in my article here: <a href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/facebook-ads/">How I Got 532 Subscribers in 43 Days Using Cheap Facebook Ads.</a></p>

<p>Now you are ready to create a Facebook ad to drive traffic to the landing page with your incentive!</p>

<p>The first step in the ad-creation process is to create an engaging image, or video, for your ad...</p>

<h2>How to Get Maximum Engagment From Your Ad</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether you choose to use a still image or a video, there is one thing that it must do in order to get the most engagement for your ad (more clicks, likes, comments, shares, etc.):</p>

<p>Your image/video must <em>relate</em> to your target audience.</p>

<p>Imagine you are arriving at a party, and everyone in the room is a complete stranger. Who would you approach first? Someone who has similar characteristics as you? Or someone who is completely different from yourself?</p>

<p>Now, some people are the extremely outgoing type, and may enjoy approaching people who are different. That’s the exception to the rule. But psychologists say that <em>most</em> of us say “yes” to those who we perceive to be similar to ourselves.</p>

<p>And it works the exact same way for your Facebook ad:</p>

<div class="green-box"><p><strong>The more your ad <em>relates</em> to your target audience, the higher your engagement.</strong></p></div>

<p>The easiest way to relate to your audience? By using a relatable photo, or video, of yourself! (You can definitely pass on the stock photos.)</p>

<p>Your photo really doesn't have to be super professional in order to get good results. In fact, if it looks <em>too</em> professional, you will lose the relatability factor.</p>

<p>That being said, you also want to walk the fine line between relatability and credibility: If you don't appear to be a credible authority, you will also lose engagment.</p>

<p>That's because, as psychologists also tell us:</p>

<div class="green-box"><p><strong>People tend to trust other people based on their appearance.</strong></p></div>

<p>So how do you strike the perfect balance between relatability and credibility? The best way to do it, in my opinion, is by keeping the subject–<em>you!</em>–friendly and relatable, while keeping the <em>quality</em> of the photo (or video) itself high.</p>

<p>That's not to say that a selfie taken with a smartphone can't do just as well as a professinally-shot photo taken with a top-of-the-line DSLR camera in a professionally-lit studio. It most certainly <em>can</em> do well, and you should try it, if you are so inclined.</p>

<p>Just make sure that the subject–<em>you!</em>–looks good (good lighting, good grooming, etc.)!</p>

<h2>6 Tips For Shooting Images That Bring Out Your Inner "Relatable Rockstar"</h2>

<ol>
<li>The easiest way to get a great portrait or video is to hire a good photographer. Preferably, one who has experience with personal brands. But if you are on a tight budget, or you're just the "DIY" type, these following 5 tips are for you...</li>
<li>Find a willing friend or family member to take a photo of you. My mom and my husband take all my photos.</li>
<li>You’ll also need a decent camera, although you don’t have to have anything super fancy. iPhones work great, and are perfect for shooting video as well. For most of my shots, I use a <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/sony-a58/sony-a58A.HTM">Sony A58 DSLR.</a></li>
<li>Good lighting is key. What you want for a great portrait is soft, diffused lighting. Here are the best places to find great lighting for portraits (and videos):
<ul><li>Near a window indoors</li><li>Outdoors at golden hour (just before sunrise or sunset)</li><li>Outdoors in complete shade at midday</li><li>Outdoors on a cloudy day</li><li>Do <em>not</em> shoot with the sun directly on the subject– this will cause harsh shadows on your face!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>For video, you may need a tripod for any “talking head” shots that you want to keep perfectly still. <a href="http://joby.com/gorillapod?gclid=Cj0KEQjw35-vBRD3qKz8hPezlIIBEiQAOeKNrjkdEvgX0VOSuZr0HeEx6rrNrtJ7t9TT87qwB3k7MIUaAh0z8P8HAQ">GorillaPods</a> work great and are especially perfect if you are using a smartphone.</li>
<li>For any moving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMNVn7CB3HQ">“b-roll” shots</a> (supplemental footage that cuts in between talking head shots), I like to use the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8">Hyperlapse app</a> on my phone, which smoothes out motion without having any special equipment.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! Now you are ready to go out and shoot a super-engaging portrait or video for your Facebook ad. I would love to see your shots in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/persuasiveblog/">Persuasive Bloggers group</a>!</p>

<p>Next time, I'll show you how to write highly persuasive ad copy...</p>

<p>See you then!</p>
