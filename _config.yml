    <h4>Hi! I'm Mary Fernandez (a self-proclaimed blogoholic). In this free training, I'll show you:</h4>
    <li>The key reason why most blogs FAIL to bring in the dough. (Hint: it does NOT have to do with the quality or quantity of your content.)</li>
    <li>Why becoming the go-to expert in your field isn't as hard as you might think, and why you never have to be a fraud, or "fake it 'till you make it."</li>
    <li>How to discover what you are already an expert in and get paid for it, even if you have ZERO skills. Seriously.</li>
    <li>How to grow your following and your credibility at the SPEED OF LIGHT (well, something like that), on a tight budget.</li>
    <li>How to stand out in a crowded blogosphere and dominate your niche.</li>
    </ul>
