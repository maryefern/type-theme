Trying to reach your first 1,000+ subscribers?

What if you could get 100 or more new subscribers <em>for every blog post you write,</em> within just a few days of publishing... even if your blog is brand new?

Guest blogging is your ticket.

Writing for a popular blog in your niche gives you an instant surge of traffic and massive exposure right out the gate. Plus, you get a big credibility boost in the process (and you can start putting those "as featured in" logos up on your website)!

I think guest blogging should be on your top "to do" list if you are starting to grow your audience from scratch. Which is why I'm <em>solely</em> guest blogging right now, as opposed to writing for my own blog... It just doesn't make sense to me to publish your words somewhere where no one will see them!

Butâ€“ not all guest blogging opportunities are created equal.

If you want this strategy to work for you, you should only write for blogs that have a highly engaged audience and who will feature you in a way that allows you to get the most traffic back to your website (remember: you want to get these readers on to your email list!!). It can be a lot of work to identify which blogs are which, but thankfully, you don't have to.

Here is my list of popular blogs seeking guest posts that are worth your time to write for (i.e. writing for these blogs will give you a ton of exposure)...
