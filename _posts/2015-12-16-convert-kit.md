title: 7 Reasons to Break Up With Your Email Provider and Say "Yes" to ConvertKit

<img src="/img/cupid.gif" class="image-right">

Does your email software make you want to rip your hair out? I know the feeling...

For nearly 5 years, I was a loyal <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> customer. I was charmed by their beautifully designed user experience, and we got along together... for a while.

However, when I got really serious about growing my email list, I started resenting our relationship. I had outgrown MailChimp's features, and was sick of hacking my way around their limitations. I new I could do better.

I looked into <a href="http://www.aweber.com/">Aweber</a>, but it had many of the same limitations that were driving me nuts about MailChimp.

I also looked into various CRM (customer relationship management) systems, like <a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com/">InfusionSoft</a>, <a href="https://ontraport.com/">Ontraport</a> and the like, which were certainly more robust, but they also came with a high price tag.

I needed a solution with the features of a CRM that would be kind to my budget.

Then suddenly, the heavens opened to reveal <a href="http://mbsy.co/nathanbarry/19858214">ConvertKit</a>... 

*Cue the choir of angels!*

<h2>The Best Email Service in it's Price Range</h2>

It was love at first sight. As soon as I saw <a href="http://mbsy.co/nathanbarry/19858214">their homepage</a> with the headline, "Email Marketing for Professional Bloggers", I promptly said goodbye to MailChimp and ran into the arms of ConvertKit.

And I haven't looked back since.

Granted, they're not perfect. NO email solution is perfect. However, I believe ConvertKit currently has the best solution out there in it's price range (starting at only $29 per month for up to 1,000 subscribers), and it is only getting better as they continue to add more features and improvements.

So, are you ready to see if you and ConvertKit are a match made in heaven? Here's how to determine whether you're ready to kiss your old email service goodbye...

<h2>1. You Have Multiple Opt-In Incentives</h2>

<p>Have you ever tried to deliver more than one opt-in incentive (a.k.a. "lead magnet") with MailChimp or Aweber? It's ridiculously complicated, right?</p>

<p>Because these other email services only allow for one opt-in form per email list, you have to create multiple email lists just to deliver multiple incentives!</p>

<p>It's crazy that something so crucial to email marketing (incentivizing people to get on your email list) is so darn hard with these solutions.</p>

<p>Not so with ConvertKit. ConvertKit allows you to create as many opt-in forms as you want, delivering all kinds of incentives (PDFs, mini courses, video series, eBooks, anything you want), easy peasy.</p>

<h2>2. You're Sick of Paying for Duplicate Subscribers</h2>

<p>As a side effect of trying to deliver more than one incentive, you'll inevitably end up with duplicate subscribers across your various email lists in MailChimp or Aweber. The problem with that? They'll charge you for each duplicate.</p>

<p>ConvertKit handles subscribers completely differently. Each subscriber is handled as ONE subscriber. If they opt-in to multiple different incentives, it only counts them once, so you only pay once.</p>

<p>Even more exciting, you can view all the offers that a subscriber has signed up for, along with all of that subscriber's activity, on one screen:</p>

<h2>3. Creating & Sending Autoresponders is Giving You the Heebie-Jeebies</h2>

<p>What if you wanted to send a general welcome series to all your subscribers, but you also want to send a specific autoresponder to each person, depending on where they opted in?</p>

<p>What if you wanted to send subscribers to a new email series after they complete the first one?</p>

<p>If you're using most email providers, good luck with that. But ConvertKit makes it easy...</p>

<p>Here's what the autoresponder series creation screen looks like (they call these "courses"):</p>

<img src="/img/convertkit3.png">

<p>See how easy it is to view the entire series at a glance?</p>

<p>You can also trigger these "courses" (again, don't let the name fool you... it's just an autoresponder series like any other) to be sent according to certain events from the Automations screen:</p>

<h2>4. You'd L-O-V-E a Built-In Landing Page Creator</h2>

<p>Yes, you can create landing pages with ConvertKit. Try to compete with that, MailChimp!</p>

<p>Granted, it's nothing super fancy, and there's only one simple template. But, if you're on a tight budget and you want your email software to multitask, this is a completely serviceable solution. You can even host the landing page on your own domain!</p>

<p>Here's what the lanidng page creator looks like:</p>

<h2>5. You Need to Check Conversion Rates & Create Campaigns</h2>

<p>This is something that is terrible in MailChimp, but ConvertKit excels at it: statistics for every opt-in form!</p>
<p>For example, I can see that currently my homepage is converting at only 4.5%, whereas my Blog Growth Blueprint landing page is converting at 37.8%:</p>

<img src="/img/convertkit6.png">

<p>Another cool feature is the ability to track specific campaigns. Here's what I mean...</p>

<p>Let's say you are running Facebook ads to a landing page, and you want to know which ads are giving you the best results. To create a campaign, you can append the landing page URL with an extra string to "tag" it, like so:</p>

<p>http://YourLandingPage.com/<span class="highlight">?ref=YourCampaignName</span></p>

<p>Then, you can view the stats for each campaign. You can also view your top referrers:</p>

<img src="/img/convertkit7.png">

<p>This tells me that my "fbwedmore" campaign yielded 25 visitors, and 5 of those people opted in, whereas my "fbbloggingboost" campaign yielded 61 visitors with 15 people opting in.</p>

<h2>6. You'd Like to Move Existing Subscribers Further Along Your Funnel</h2>

<p>Here's another cool thing you can do with ConvertKit: you can show different opt-in forms depending on whether someone is already a subscriber or not!</p>

<p>What could you do with this feature? Well, you could push those people who've already opted in further down your sales funnel.</p>

<p>For instance, let's say someone opted in to <a href="http://persuasiveblog.com/fbadsclass/">my free mini course on Facebook ads.</a> Instead of seeing that same opt-in form again, I could show them a link to a landing page for a premium course on Facebook ads.</p>

<p>Here's what that feature looks like:</p>

<h2>7. Your Paying Customers Deserve Special Treatment</h2>

<p>ConvertKit has a number of integrations that allow you to send autoresponders or one-off broadcasts specifically to people who have purchased your product. This can come in handy for thanking customers for purchasing, or pitching a higher-end product later.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can <em>exclude</em> customers from receiving sales emails after they have purchased.</p>

<p>At first glance, you may be thinking that MailChimp does the same thing. And it does... sort of. But when it comes to triggering autoresponder sequences according to these rules, it just feels way easier and simpler with ConvertKit, and the possibilities for what you can do seem almost endless.</p>

<p>Here are the integrations that are currently available (I'm sure many more will be added down the road):</p>

<h2>Yet Another Reason to Love ConvertKit...</h2>

<p>If you'd rather support a small startup than a large company, it's another reason to love ConvertKit.</p>

<p>ConvertKit's creator, <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/">Nathan Barry</a>, is very responsive and will often personally reply to your techincal support questions and feature requests. I'm not sure how long that will last as the company grows, but for now it's a nice personal touch, and it's great to know that you are supporting a fellow entrepreneur.</p>
