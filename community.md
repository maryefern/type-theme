<p>We are serious bloggers and entrepreneurs, on our way to becoming the top experts in our fields. Beginners to advanced bloggers are welcome.</p>

<p>To apply, <em>you must have a blog for your business, or you are planning to launch one.</em> (We are looking to make money online. We are not "hobby" bloggers, even though we think those blogs are great too.)</p>

<p>Most importantly, you must have the drive and work ethic to overcome obstacles and <em>take action</em>. We are world-changers and future world-changers, and we are passionate about giving value to everyone around us. If you do not have anything supportive or positive to add to the discussion, please do <em>not</em> join this group.</p>

<p>Promoting your business is prohibited unless specifically asked for. However, from time to time, Mary will feature noteworthy bloggers from the group who are doing something special or extraordinary!</p>
