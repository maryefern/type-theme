<p>We are serious bloggers and entrepreneurs, on our way to becoming some of the top experts in our fields. Beginners to advanced bloggers are welcome.</p>

<p>To apply, <em>you must have a blog for your business, or you are planning to launch one.</em> (We are looking to make money online. We are not "hobby" bloggers, even though we think those blogs are awesome.)</p>

<p>Most importantly, you must have the drive and work ethic to overcome obstacles and <em>take action</em>. We are world-changers and future world-changers, and we are passionate about giving value to everyone around us. If you do not have anything positive or supportive to add to the discussion, please do <em>not</em> join this group.</p>

<p><em>Promoting your business is prohibited</em> unless specifically asked for. However, Mary will give you opportunities to promote your blog and, from time to time, Mary will also feature noteworthy bloggers from the group who are doing something special or extraordinary!</p>
