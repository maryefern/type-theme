<div class="text-align-left">
<p>At this point, you have created an irresistible incentive to attract your target audience, and you became a "relatable rockstar" when you shot your engaging ad image (or video).</p>
<p>The next step is to write ad copy that persuades your target audience to click and subscribe to your email list!</p>
<p>There are many different ways of writing your ad copy, and you should experiment to find out what works best for your target audience.</p>
<p>However, I have learned from experience, and from spying on many other advertisers, that there is a formula that just seems to work each and every time... just like magic.</p>
<p>It's virtually fool-proof.</p>
<p>Ready to learn the formula?</p>
<p>It's a quick and simple template that you can plug and play:</p>
<h2>The Fool-Proof Facebook Ad Copy Formula</h2>
<div class="green-box"><h4><em>Headline:</em> FREE <u>INCENTIVE</u>: <u>Brief Description</u></h4></div>
<p>Remember how your incentive needs to be relevant to your audience, and the more relevant it is the better your ad will convert? Well, your headline's job is to explain what your incentive is, in a few short words. If your incentive is highly relevant to your target audience, it will basically sell itself.</p>
<p>All you need to do is make sure it is crystal clear what they get when they sign up (is it a PDF download? a video? a mini course? an eBook?). And make sure to mention that your offer is FREE.</p>
<p><strong>Example #1:</strong> <em>FREE MINI COURSE: Build a Website From Scratch</em></p>
<p><strong>Example #2:</strong> <em>FREE VIDEO: Build Trust, Authority & Profit in Your Business</em></p>
<p><strong>Example #3:</strong> <em>FREE FITNESS CHALLENGE: Say it, Sweat it, Get it</em></p>

<div class="green-box"><h4><em>Text:</em> <u>Hook question</u>? <u>Establish authority</u>. <u>Quick win</u>. <u>How to sign up</u>.</h4></div>
<img src="/img/wedmore-ad.png" style="max-width:400px;float:right;margin-left:1em;">
<p>In the first sentence, ask a question that hooks your target reader by asking them if they want the RESULT that your incentive gives them.</p>
<p>In the second sentence, establish your authority by making a statement that proves you have something valuable to say on the topic.</p>
<p>(You don't have to have special credentials to have authority on a topic... If you used to feel the same way as your target reader, then condense that story down to one sentence.)</p>
<p>In the third sentence, state your "quick win". What will they be able to accomplish, what baby step will they have achieved, as a result of consuming your incentive?</p>
<p>In the last sentence, state very clearly how to sign up, and include the URL to your landing page.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<em><p>Are you looking to grow your business with YouTube? For the past 7 years, I've been teaching entrepreneurs how to build their brand with video!</p>
<p>I'm hosting a new webinar showing you The 7 Steps to Profiting from YouTube!</p>
<p>To reserve your spot click the link below:</p>
<p>http://www.example.com</p></em>

<div class="green-box"><h4><em>News Feed Description:</em> <u>Quick win OR call-to-action</u></h4></div>
<p>You have a couple of choices for this section (this is the copy that goes just below the Headline in the News Feed).</p>
<p>You can briefly explain why your incentive is a "quick win".</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>If you can spare just 5 mins per day, you can do this challenge!</em></p>
<p>Or, you can state the call-to-action.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Click the link to sign up now!</em></p>

<div class="green-box"><h4><em>Call-to-Action Button:</em> Sign Up (OR Learn More)</h4></div>
<p>Choosing the <em>Sign Up</em> button usually works best for this kind of Facebook Ad, because we are asking them to give us their email address before they get the incentive. It is important that the button accurately states what is going to happen when they click on it.</p>
<p>However, if your landing page provides a lot of content and valuable information <em>up front</em>, then you could use the <em>Learn More</em> button.</p>
<p>(<em>Learn More</em> may convert better because it sounds like less of a committment than <em>Sign Up</em>. However, <em>only</em> use it if you actually have more information on your landing page.)</p>
<h2>Go write some persuasive ad copy!</h2>
<p>Now you have a fool-proof template for getting the click to subscribe. After this, you will be done creating your ad, and all you'll have to do is set it up and run it!</p>
