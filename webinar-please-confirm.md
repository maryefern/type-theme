                    <p>You still need to confirm your e-mail address. If you skip this LAST step, I will not be able to send you any e-mails, so I won't be able to save your spot in the webinar and you won't have access. Now isn't that enough to make a grown man cry??</p>

(If it's not there, check your spam folder!)</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Open the e-mail and click on the "Yes, subscribe me to this list" button.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Your registration details will be sent to you!</p></div>

<p class="small"><em>Pssst!</em> Sometimes genuine e-mails can get confused by the spam-checkers and sent to your spam folder. So if after confirming your e-mail address, you don't receive another e-mail from me within <strong>5 minutes</strong>, check your Promotions Tab (for Gmail users), and check your spam folder. If it's still not there, <a href="mailto:mary@persuasiveblog.com">shoot me an e-mail</a> and I'll help you out.</p>
