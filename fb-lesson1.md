<p>Ever had the nagging feeling that something just isn't right?</p>

<p>That's how I felt about my previous online business.</p>

<p>I could feel it deep in my gut that something was very wrong. So wrong, in fact, that I knew I was going to have to start all over again, from scratch, with a new business idea.</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time I had to start all over again. In fact, I had built yet another online business before the last one, which failed for a different reason.</p>

<p>(Talk about trial and error!)</p>

<p>It's not that I wasn't making money. (My first blog made about $5 per subscriber per month. For frame of reference, $1 per subscriber per month is considered a good amount.)</p>

<p>The problem was, the niche itself didn't <em>feel</em> good to me. There was something fundamentally wrong, and the only way to fix it was to break everything and start again.</p>

<h2>What I learned from falling and getting back up... twice.</h2>

<p>I'm assuming that you want more from your blog than just a small hobby. You probably want to make some supplemental income, or to completely support your family. Or maybe you just want to educate people about something that you are really passionate about, and you want them to sit up and pay attention.</p>

<p>The point is, you are serious enough about your blog to plunk down some money on Facebook ads to grow your audience.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't have a huge budget (yet), but you are willing to spend a little, especially if it means that you are going to get a bigger return on that investment in the future... like quitting your day job, or the personal fulfillment of serving others. (Or both!)</p>

<p>If you want to have success online... whether that means offering services, selling stuff, or just having an impact on people's lives... you are going to have to get serious about growing your email list. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. In fact:</p>

<div class="green-box">
<p><strong>Having an email list is the <em>only</em> way to have any real impact online. And the bigger your list, the bigger your impact.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>After all, you can't serve anyone if you don't have a way to tell them how you can be of service. And the best way to contact people over the internet is by email.</p>

<p>What I've learned from building two online businesses and starting all over again (twice!) is that growing your email list doesn't have to take a lot of time.</p>

<img src="/img/snail.jpg" class="image-right">

<p>That's surprising to a lot of people because most bloggers think that watching your list grow like a snail crossing the road is par for the course in blogging. But in fact, that's a <em>terrible</em> idea. (Imagine if you were that snail...)</p>

<h3>Secret #1: Growing your list slowly is a BAD idea.</h3>

<p>Contrary to the beloved fable, this is when you need to be fast like the Hare, <em>not</em> slow like the Tortoise.</p>

<p>Why is growing your list slowly a bad thing? Here are a couple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>The longer it takes to grow your list, the longer it takes to get proof of concept for your idea.</em> Getting proof of concept quickly means you'll know whether your idea is going to work or not before you waste too much time on it.</li>
<li><em>If you're growing your list slowly, it will be really difficult to correct course.</em> Because somewhere along the line, you may realize that you've made a wrong turn (such as attracting the wrong people to your list, or choosing the wrong topic for your blog), and you'll just have too much invested in the old path to forge a new one.</li>
</ol>

<p>You see, when I left my first blog to start a new one on a different topic, I was so invested in my subscribers that I couldn't bring myself to give them up... I had a little over 500 at the time, and it took me <em>3 years</em> (using all-organic traffic methods) to get to that point. I simply couldn't fathom giving up 3 years of hard work to start all over from 0.</p>

<p>It seemed like a smart move at the time, but I tried to come up with a new topic that would also be of interest to my previous audience. That way, instead of starting from 0, I could keep building upon the 500 subscribers I already had.</p>

<p>Good idea, right?</p>

<p>Well, the problem was, I ended up feeling unhappy with my choice of topic. It just wasn't the right fit for me, and it didn't feel authentic. I should have felt like I was on top of the world, creating my life's work, fulfilling my destiny! But instead, I felt like a fraud doing something I had forced myself into for "business reasons".</p>

<p>(Consequently, only 1 out of the 500 actually converted from my old list to my new list, so I didn't even succeed in my original intent. How about that for a double whammy!)</p>

<p>I'm not saying that you are going to have to start all over again like I did. I don't want that for you. What I'm saying is that you can learn from my revelation...</p>

<p>That second time around, it took me less than <em>2 months</em> to build a brand new list from 1 to 500+ subscribers! And that's when my eyes were opened to the power of cheap Facebook ads.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is:

<h3>Secret #2: Don't choose a blog topic that you <em>think</em> will be easy because you think list-building is hard.</h3>

<p>It's not hard. (Especially once you get through this course.)</p>

<p>So choose a topic that you are confident will help a lot of people, because you rock at it, and it puts you on top of the world. You owe it to yourself and those you are serving to do something truly meaningful with your life.</p>

<h2>One More Thing You Need to Succeed (Hint: It Has <em>Nothing</em> to Do with Facebook Ads)</h2>

<p>By using Facebook ads, I was able to grow my list quickly, which meant that I was no longer stuck in a niche that didn't suit me... I was free to choose any topic I wanted!</p>

<p>BUT– and this is a <em>big</em> "but"– I couldn't have done it alone.</p>

<h3>Secret #3: Don't try to do it alone</h3>

<img src="/img/mastermind.jpg" class="image-right medium">
<p>I had a group of really smart and successful friends helping me to come up with a plan for growing that list.</p>

<p>I'm talking about James Wedmore, Rick Mulready, Kimra Luna, Hilary Rushford, Nicole Sainz Di Rocco, Staci Ann Karim, Phoebe Mroczek, Melissa Khodai-Burkheimer, Olivier Doremieux, and Clint Francis Entorum.</p>

<p>How did I become friends with all those people? Well, by paying $2,500 to attend a mastermind with them. :-)</p>
